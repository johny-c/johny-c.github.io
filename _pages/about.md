Born and raised in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Athens,+Greece/@40.9610642,15.3731969,5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x14a1bd1f067043f1:0x2736354576668ddd!8m2!3d37.9838096!4d23.7275388">Athens, Greece</a>. I loved math from an early age. In high school, I got into playing music (drums & guitar) and with my longest lasting band, f.i.n.e., we even made our own <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0VDWER9FXUhU8EnRtTjSXk">album</a>!

I got my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.teiath.gr">Technological Educational Institute of Athens</a> in 2012. That's where I got the bug of AI, Neural Networks and Robotics. I went on to get a M.Sc. in Computer Science (Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence) from the <a href="https://www.tum.de/">Technical University of Munich</a> in 2015. From October 2015 until April 2021, I was a <a href="https://vision.in.tum.de/members/chiotell">PhD student</a> in the <a href="https://vision.in.tum.de/">Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Group</a>, headed by Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers at TUM. During my PhD, I did research in a diverse set of problems, trying to make them benefit from Machine Learning techniques. I am especially fascinated with Metric Learning, goal-conditioned RL and graph algorithms.

Since May 2021, I am an ML engineer at Apple, Munich.
