Born and raised in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Athens,+Greece">Athens, Greece</a>. I loved math from an early age. In high school, I got into playing music (drums & guitar) and with my longest lasting band, f.i.n.e., we even made our own <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0VDWER9FXUhU8EnRtTjSXk">album</a>!

I got my B.Sc. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.teiath.gr">Technological Educational Institute</a> of Athens in 2012. That's where I got the bug of AI, Neural Networks and Robotics. I went on to get a M.Sc. in Computer Science (Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence) from the <a href="https://www.tum.de/">Technical University of Munich</a> in 2015. Since October 2015, I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://vision.in.tum.de/">Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Group</a>, headed by Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers at TUM. In my PhD, I did research in a diverse set of problems, trying to make them benefit from Machine Learning techniques. I am especially fascinated with Metric Learning, goal-conditioned RL and graph algorithms.
